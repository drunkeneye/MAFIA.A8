It is the year 1930 in Chicago. 
Alcohol is prohibited, crime thrives. 
Store  owners live in constant fear of
robberies and extortions, which are 
becoming more frequent. Anyone can 
obtain illegal firearms, and the 
corrupt police are no help. You are a
nobody just released from prison, 
even hot dog vendors laugh at you. 
Enough is enough. You crave control of
the underworld. But the path to the 
mafia throne is long and hard. 

Will you succeed?
