====================
M A F I A  -  MANUAL
====================


It is the year 1930 in Chicago.  Alcohol is prohibited, crime thrives. 
Store  owners live in constant fear of robberies and extortions, which are
becoming more frequent. Anyone can obtain illegal firearms, and the corrupt
police are no help. 

You are a nobody just released from prison, even hot dog vendors laugh at you.
Enough is enough. You crave control of the underworld. But the path to the 
mafia throne is long and hard. 

Will you succeed?



Goal 
====

Rise up and become the boss of the underworld!
Compete against your fellow players!

For every job, every murder, every smuggling, every bribery, and every
robbery you gain more fame (and points).

But only those who manage to 'turn' the mayor in the end and 'borrow'
the gold in the money transporter can be the boss of the underworld...




Controls
========

The game is controlled with the keyboard, but almost always you can also
use the keyboard.

Map:
ESC = Show gangsters and current game status




Fight
=====

Combat is turn-based, each gangster can move or shoot.

Press Return to draw your weapon and an arrow key to shoot in that
direction.

q = Give up the fight (beginners only)
i = Activate the AI (after the next move)
Space = Skip the round
